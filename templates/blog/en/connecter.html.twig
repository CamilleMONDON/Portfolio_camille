    <p>To guarantee quality of service to users, I performed a rigorous qualification of the existing setup and environment:</br> </br>Copper infrastructure audit: Expert use of the Fluke CableIQ qualifier to validate link compliance (continuity, length < 90m) and certify their capacity to support the 1000BASE-T protocol (Gigabit Ethernet).</br> </br>Wi-Fi Optimization: Spectral analysis of the environment to map coverage. I conducted a detailed study of the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) to select the most efficient channels (1, 6, 11) and ensure a stable signal, beyond simple reception power.</p>

  <div class="tab-pane fade border-primary" id="02" style="background-color: var(--card-bg)" role="tabpanel">
    <p>I designed the physical engineering of the deployment by anticipating future needs (installation sustainability):</br> </br>Precise sizing: Calculation of material requirements for a large-scale installation (3 km of cables, 58 RJ45 jacks, 2 patch panels).</br> </br>Estimation methodology: Development of a reliable calculation method based on building scale plans (average distance + technical safety margin) to make orders reliable.</br> </br>Strategic choices: Selection of ISO/IEC 11801 standard equipment (Legrand, Category 6, Class E) to ensure network durability.</p>

    <p>I acted as the interface between the technical side and the decision-maker ("the client") to validate the project launch: </br> </br>Budgeting: Drafting a formal and detailed quote (€17,471 incl. VAT). I integrated a realistic labor estimate (based on a 35h simulation at a qualified technician rate) to make the offer credible.</br> </br>Commercial argumentation: Presentation of the technical and financial file, adapting my vocabulary and posture to convince the department head of the investment necessity.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to connect user needs (fast and reliable connection) with business constraints (budget, standards, architecture).</p>
    <p class="card-text">Key takeaways:</p>
    <p class="card-text">Mastery of certification tools (Fluke) is essential for transforming a physical installation into a reliable service.</p>
    <p class="card-text">Good technical communication is not limited to transmitting data, but translating it into decision-making elements (costs, deadlines, quality) for the client.</p>
